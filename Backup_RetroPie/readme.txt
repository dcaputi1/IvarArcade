steps to create an SD image baseline
------------------------------------

preliminary:
a. use pi imager tool to create an SD pi5 64-bit full OS image with:
   enabled wifi credentials, wifi country US, user danc, host McAtariPi5
b. boot to desktop GUI
c. enable raspberry pi connect
d. install updates
e. preferences, pi config, localization US UTF-8 for all
f. reboot and run:
> locale (confirm all US UTF-8)
> git clone https://github.com/dcaputi1/IvarArcade.git
  then reload this readme.txt from ~/IvarArcade/Backup_RetroPie, make sure nothing above changed
> git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup.git
> cd RetroPie-Setup
> sudo ./retropie_setup.sh
g. install all core packs
   12/30/2025 - RetroArch must be installed from source! (compatable with lr-mame)
h. install experimantal mame package (~2 hours from source)
   1/15/2026 - installed from binary
i. install experimental lr-mame (~2 hours from source)
   1/11/2026 - installed from binary
j. enable autostart emulationstation
k. edit autostart.sh and replace 'emulationstation' with 'wayfire-pi' (for remote gui)

steps:
1. ~/IvarArcade/Backup_RetroPie/cp_roms.sh (~1 hours)
2. create empty roms breakout.zip and pong.zip:
   touch ~/RetroPie/roms/arcade/breakout.zip
   touch ~/RetroPie/roms/arcade/pong.zip
3. add paths for mame and (optional) retroarch, frontends to /etc/profile (user long path)
   :/opt/retropie/emulators/mame:/opt/retropie/emulators/retroarch/bin
4. sudo ~/IvarArcade/Backup_RetroPie/analyze_games.sh (installs tinyxml2 and python3-hid packages)
5. mkdir -p /opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch/config/MAME
6. build and install IvarArcade project components:
   cd ~/IvarArcade
   make all
   make install-force # deploys binaries, scripts, plugins, etc...
   1/11/2026 - TBD: combine those 2 steps?
7. reboot (for path to take effect)
8. clone, build, install ultrastikcmd tool for per-game joystick mapping:
   mkdir -p ~/IvarArcade/tools/linux
   cd ~/IvarArcade/tools/linux
   git clone https://github.com/dcaputi1/UltrastikCmd.git
   ./build.sh
   sudo ldconfig -v | grep libhid
   (verify ldconfig shows libhid.so.0 -> libhid.so.0.0.0)
9. sudo ~/IvarArcade/Backup_RetroPie/cp_opt.sh
   1/13/2026 - not much to 'copy' from opt (TBD - omit and rename the script)
10.run ~/marquees/bin/analyze_games (not sudo!)
11.sudo ~/scripts/set_asound.sh (for Trixie sound problem - not needed for Bookworm Debian base OS)

optional:
A. sudo apt install meld
B. sudo apt install joystick
C. sudo apt install jstest-gtk
D. sudo apt install code
required:
E. sudo apt install fuse-zip (mounts zip file w/ PNGs)
   sudo nano /etc/fuse.conf and uncomment #user_allow_other

problem log:
1/11/26 [x] ES launch in-game tab menu, return/backspace swapped
        [ ] file missed: /opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch/retroarch.cfg (NA?)
        [x] file diffs: /opt/retropie/configs/arcade/retroarch.cfg
            input_playerN_joypad_index (2,3,4,0,1)
            cfg_ra/sa coins
        [x] qbert.ini joymap NFG
        [x] git and AI got stupid: I wound up logged into GIT as dcaputi1-dev
        from then on, using the GUI or AI for source control was impossible.
        No clue how it happened or how to avoid it in the future.
        Re-baseline the SD card and pay more attention when launching VS Code!
1/14/26 [x] Missing ES controler setup (goes straight to Gamepad setup)
        added install-force target
1/15/26 can't run ES game
        [ ] missing /opt/retropie/reroarch/retroarch.cfg
        [x] link to mame in /opt/retropie/configs/mame/mame (maybe should be parent)
        [ ] mame installed in /opt/retropie/retroarch/mame (does it work SA?)
        [ ] missing /opt/retropie/emulators/retroarch/bin/retroarch
1/16/26 [x] redo SD baseline because too many diffs yesterday (BTW, other comments lost to bad CM)
1/17/26 [x] tracking link to mame in mame/mame from 1/15 - weird...
        apparently retroarch mame package install creates a ~/.mame symlink to /opt/retropie/configs/mame so that when my cp_opt.sh does this:
        ln -s /opt/retropie/emulators/mame/ /home/danc/.mame
        we create a link 'mame' in /opt/retropie/configs/mame to /opt/retropie/emulators/mame
        [x] cp_opt.sh - no scripts in ~/scripts (get rid of step for now) where are all my scripts?
        [x] move cp_opt.sh to last step (make install-final must run first)
        [x] xinmo swap failed (never updated after moved from joycode 4-5 to 2-3)
        [x] moved default.cfg R/O to EOF (but no can do - see next comment)
        [x] xinmo swap unable to write default.cfg (keep it 666)
1/20/26 [x] redo again - games don't load (make install-force wasn't run?)
1/24/26 [ ] leds don't work unless start buttons are defined (some games use player buttons)
